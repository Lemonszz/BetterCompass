# Better Compass

Better Compass lets you set your compass wherever you want!

Simply right click with a normal compass to set it's position. By default compass will face towards the world spawn as usual.

You can simply put your compass in a crafting bench to clear the link.

If you prefer to keep the standard compass, you can enable the "Use Homing Compass Instead" option which creates a new type of compass.
